# Movie-Rating-Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting movie ratings based on various features using machine learning techniques. The aim is to build a model that can accurately predict how a user might rate a movie based on certain characteristics, such as genre, cast, director, and other relevant factors.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project likely includes several features that contribute to predicting movie ratings. These features might include:

Movie Features: Genre, Director, Cast, Release Year, etc.
User Features: User demographics, viewing history, etc. (if available)
Rating: The target variable, representing the movie rating.
